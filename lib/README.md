# Overview

This app is a workout calculator. The idea of it is to allow the user to input their workout regime and the app will give feedback on what muscle groups the user is over or under working. This project isn't finished yet. This program is just a skeleton of the description previously mentioned. As of right now it reads a workout and tells the user what muscle group that workout targets.

I created this app to help bith long term gym-goers as well as beginners how they can better optimize their workout. WHen I first started I didn't have a strong idea on what I was doing. The purpose of this app is to allow people to modify their workout to be the most efficient workout possible.
